# Automated-Essay-Scoring-System
In this project, an automated essay scoring system is built to score essays as human expert graders. Because of the subjectivity and the fact that process is time consuming, methods of checking student’s grasp of course material have become uncreative and now include multiple-choice or fill-in-blank tests. These limit the ability of students to express their understanding freely and emphatically. If the manual grading process can be relieved by an efficient and accurate automated grading system, essays and other creative methods could be frequently used to indicate academic achievements. We are introducing a model that forms word representations by learning the extent to which specific words contribute to the text’s score and predict a final essay grade on a marking scale. Our model will typically use a large range of textual features that correspond to different properties of text, such as grammar, vocabulary, style, topic relevance, and discourse coherence and cohesion.
